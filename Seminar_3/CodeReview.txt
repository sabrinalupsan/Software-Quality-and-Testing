Code Review

Stage 1. Naming conventions

-rename Clasa1 to something more meaningful
-rename Calculeaza - use small caps
-rename the function arguments
-rename rezultate
-rename valoare
-format code

-remove hardcoded values
-validate your input values
-replace the if-then-else with switch

Stage 2. KISS, Single responsability -> reduce functions complexity
-remove the switch by using a generic approach for each product type
-outsource the validations and the way the fidelity discount is computed

Stage 3. Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
-remove the dependency regarding the validation of input values
-remove the dependency on the static values (they are given by the marketing team)
